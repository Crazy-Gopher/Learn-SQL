# Null handling

Null handling in SQL refers to how SQL treats NULL values, which represent missing or unknown data in a database table. Handling NULL values properly is important in database operations to ensure accurate results and avoid unexpected behavior. Here are some common ways SQL handles NULL values:

Comparison with NULL:

Comparisons with NULL using comparison operators such as =, !=, <, >, etc., typically result in unknown (or NULL) rather than true or false. For example, NULL = NULL and NULL != NULL both evaluate to NULL, not true or false.
IS NULL and IS NOT NULL:

To check if a value is NULL or not NULL, SQL provides the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators. For example:
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
Aggregate Functions and NULL:

Aggregate functions like SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), etc., generally ignore NULL values. They calculate the result based on the non-NULL values in the specified column.
Null-Safe Comparison Operator (<=>):

Some database systems provide a null-safe comparison operator <=> that compares two expressions, treating NULL values as equal. For example:
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name <=> NULL;
COALESCE() Function:

The COALESCE() function is used to return the first non-NULL value among its arguments. It can be helpful for replacing NULL values with a default value.
sql
Copy code
SELECT COALESCE(column_name, 'default_value') FROM table_name;
IFNULL() / ISNULL() Function:

Some database systems provide IFNULL() or ISNULL() functions to return a specified value if a column is NULL.
sql
Copy code
SELECT IFNULL(column_name, 'default_value') FROM table_name;
Handling NULLs in Joins:

When joining tables, NULL values may affect the results. To handle NULL values appropriately, you may need to use OUTER JOINS or COALESCE() function to provide default values.
Understanding and properly handling NULL values is essential for writing correct and efficient SQL queries and ensuring data integrity in a database.













Handling NULL values in arithmetic operations in SQL requires special consideration to avoid unexpected results or errors. Here's how NULL values are typically handled in various arithmetic operations:

Addition (+) and Subtraction (-):

If either operand in an addition or subtraction operation is NULL, the result will be NULL. For example:
sql
Copy code
SELECT 5 + NULL; -- Result: NULL
SELECT 10 - NULL; -- Result: NULL
Multiplication (*) and Division (/):

If any operand in a multiplication or division operation is NULL, the result will be NULL. For example:
sql
Copy code
SELECT 3 * NULL; -- Result: NULL
SELECT 20 / NULL; -- Result: NULL
NULLIF() Function:

The NULLIF() function compares two expressions and returns NULL if they are equal, otherwise it returns the first expression. This function can be useful for handling NULL values in calculations.
sql
Copy code
SELECT NULLIF(column1, 0) FROM table_name; -- Returns NULL if column1 is 0
COALESCE() Function:

The COALESCE() function can also be used to handle NULL values in calculations by replacing them with a default value.
sql
Copy code
SELECT COALESCE(column1, 0) * 10 FROM table_name; -- Replaces NULL with 0
CASE Statement:

You can use the CASE statement to handle NULL values conditionally in arithmetic operations.
sql
Copy code
SELECT CASE WHEN column1 IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE column1 END * 10 FROM table_name;
Handling Division by Zero:

Division by zero results in an error in SQL. To handle division by zero, you can use NULLIF() or CASE statement to check for zero divisor.
sql
Copy code
SELECT CASE WHEN divisor_column = 0 THEN NULL ELSE dividend_column / divisor_column END FROM table_name;
It's important to carefully consider how NULL values should be handled in arithmetic operations based on the specific requirements of your query. Improper handling of NULL values can lead to unexpected results or errors in your SQL statements.
